variables
=========
3 types of variables
=====================
1.instance variable -- (non static variable)
=====================
1.it should be declared in class level(not inside the metthod)outside the method.
2. no need to assingn the value
3.instance variable  can be declare with any access specifier  and modifier(excepted abstract)
4.scope of the variable will be based on the access specifier and modifiers
5. if i didnt assign the value to instance variable ,it will take default value as 0;

syntax
======
private int a=10;
int a;

2.static variable
================= 
1.it should be declared in class level(not inside the metthod)outside the method.
2. no need to assingn the value
3.static can be declare with any access specifier  and modifier(static,final) 
4.scope of the variable will be based on the access specifier and modifiers
5. if i didnt assign the value to instance variable ,it will take default value as 0

example
========
private static int a=10;
int a;

3.loacal variable
=================
1.it should be declared inside the method-- method level variable
2.value should be assigned
3.don't declare any specifier and  modifiers because scope of local variable is within the method
4. local variable does not have any default value
5.if local variable and instance variable(class level),value assind for both.value will be taken from local variable only.
if local variable doesnt have value then it will take the value from instance variable.
